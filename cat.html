                        Cats are very clever and playful, they can also be lazy at times. Cats are automatically potty trained as they like to go do their business in the litter, and they are self cleaning animals. Cats are also very indipendant, this makes them a very good pet for people with very busy lives. Cats only need about 15 minuites of play time as excursise, so they dont need to be walked. If you need a cuddle buddy you cat will be there for you. Each cat is very diffrent, cats can be taught diffrent tricks depending on the cat. The cat can even be walked if the cat you own likes the outdoors.

		<div class="carousel-item"><p style = "color: white;"><img src="assets/images/wideimages/wide.png" alt="" title="">
			<!--<img src="assets/images/Persian.jpeg" alt="" title=""> -->
			<p class= "info">Breed: Persian</p>
			<p style = "color: white;" class= "info">Size: Medium</p>
			<p style = "color: white;" class= "info">Life Span: 12 – 17 years</p>
			<p style = "color: white;" class= "info">Colour: Black, Black & Cream, Red, Cream, and Blue</p>
			<p style = "color: white;" class= "info">Personality: The dignified and docile Persian is known for being quiet and sweet. She is an ornament to any home where she can enjoy sitting in a lap—surely her rightful place—being petted by those who are discerning enough to recognize her superior qualities, and playing house with kind children who will gently comb her hair, wheel her around in a baby buggy, then serve her tea at their parties. Persians are affectionate but discriminating. They reserve their attention for family members and those few guests whom they feel they can trust.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="carousel-item"><img src="assets/images/wideimages/wide.png" alt="" title="">
			<p class= "info">Breed: Egyptian Mau</p>
			<p class= "info">Size: Medium</p>
			<p class= "info">Life Span: 12 – 15 years</p>
			<p class= "info">Colour: Bronze, Dark Brown, Black, and Silver</p>
			<p class= "info">Personality: When the Egyptian Mau is happy, you know it. He vocalizes (called chortling) in a quiet, pleasant voice, swishes his tail rapidly, and kneads with his front paws. What makes him happy is being with his family, to whom he is fiercely devoted, or showing off his hunting prowess by chasing and retrieving a tossed toy or stalking and pouncing on a wriggling lure at the end of a fishing pole toy.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="carousel-item"><img src="assets/images/wideimages/wide.png" alt="" title="">
			<p class= "info">Breed: Sphynx</p>
			<p class= "info">Size: Medium</p>
			<p class= "info">Life Span: 9 – 15 years</p>
			<p class= "info">Colour: Black, White, Red, Chocolate, and Lavander</p>
			<p class= "info">Personality: it’s a good thing that the Sphynx loves attention because he draws it wherever he goes. He is demanding of human attention and will do anything for a laugh. “Look at me!” is his catchphrase. That makes him easy to handle by veterinarians or anyone else, and it’s not unusual for a Sphynx to be a therapy cat since he is so fond of meeting people.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="carousel-item"><img src="assets/images/wideimages/wide.png" alt="" title="">
			<p class= "info">Breed: Himalayan</p>
			<p class= "info">Size: Medium</p>
			<p class= "info">Life Span: 15 years</p>
			<p class= "info">Colour: White, Blue, Chocolate , Red, Lilac and Cream</p>
			<p class= "info">Personality: Like the Persian, the Himalayan is sweet, docile and quiet. She is an ornament to any home where she can enjoy sitting in a lap—surely her rightful place—being petted by those who are discerning enough to recognize her superior qualities, and playing house with kind children who will gently comb her hair, wheel her around in a baby buggy (but not dress her up), let her chase an interactive toy, then serve her tea at their parties. Himalayans are affectionate but discriminating.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="carousel-item"><img src="assets/images/wideimages/wide.png" alt="" title="">
			<p class= "info">Breed: Bengal</p>
			<p class= "info">Size: Large</p>
			<p class= "info">Life Span: 14 - 16 years</p>
			<p class= "info">Colour: Tri, Brown, Dark Golden, Grey, Blue Belton, Blue, and Silver</p>
			<p class= "info">Personality: The Bengal is highly active and highly intelligent. This makes him fun to live with, but he can sometimes be challenging. On the whole, the Bengal is a confident, talkative, friendly cat who is always alert. Nothing escapes his notice. He likes to play games, including fetch, and he’s a whiz at learning tricks. His nimble paws are almost as good as hands, and it’s a good thing he doesn’t have opposable thumbs or he would probably rule the world. Bored bengal cats can also adopt some unconventional (and slightly destructive) habits, including: turning light switches on and off, fishing seals out of drains and excitedly plucking CDs from your DVD player</p>

		</div>
		<div class="carousel-item"><img src="assets/images/wideimages/wide.png" alt="" title="">
			<p class= "info">Breed: American Shorthair</p>
			<p class= "info">Size: Medium</p>
			<p class= "info">Life Span: 20 years</p>
			<p class= "info">Colour: White, Blue, Black, Cream, Red, Silver, Golden, Brown, Cameo, and Bluecream</p>
			<p class= "info">Personality: The adaptable and good-natured American Shorthair retains his hunting ability, but these days he is more likely to be a family companion, a job at which he excels. He has a middle-of-the-road temperament, being calm but not comatose. The American Shorthair is moderately active and enjoys a good playtime as much as the next cat, but he’s not overly demanding of attention or activity. As befits a working class cat who has made good, he is smart and enjoys playing with puzzle toys and interactive toys. He has a sociable nature and isn’t the type to hide under the bed when visitors arrive. This is a placid cat but one that doesn’t especially like being carried around.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="carousel-item"><img src="assets/images/wideimages/wide.png" alt="" title="">
			<p class= "info">Breed: American Bobtail</p>
			<p class= "info">Size: Large</p>
			<p class= "info">Life Span: 13 - 15 years</p>
			<p class= "info">Colour: black, brown, chocolate, cinnamon, blue, lilac, fawn, red, and cream</p>
			<p class= "info">Personality: American Bobtail lovers say you should take a look at their cat instead. He’s a lover with a heart of gold who is devoted to his people, follows them around, loves to play, walks nicely on a leash (after training, of course), and welcomes guests with a smile.This is a smart cat who enjoys puzzle toys, learning tricks, and playing fetch. He isn’t as vocal as some breeds, but he communicates his pleasure with chirps, clicks and trills, as well as the standard purr and meow.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="carousel-item"><img src="assets/images/wideimages/wide.png" alt="" title="">
			<p class= "info">Breed: Chartreux Cat</p>
			<p class= "info">Size: Large</p>
			<p class= "info">Life Span: 12 – 15 years</p>
			<p class= "info">Colour: Blue</p>
			<p class= "info">Personality: The Chartreux might well be compared to a mime, silent but communicative and sometimes silly. Short playtimes interspersed with naps and meals are his idea of the perfect day. When he is not displaying his superb timing and pouncing ability, “killing” toys with abandon, or performing acrobatic flips as he chases a lure toy, he is an attentive and gentle companion who likes to stay near his people and observe their doings. He appreciates any attention he receives, especially if it involves scratching him beneath the chin or between the ears, but he’s not demanding, content to follow you around devotedly, sleep on your bed and snuggle with you if you’re not feeling well.</p>
 
		</div>
		<div class="carousel-item"><img src="assets/images/wideimages/wide.png" alt="" title="">
			<p class= "info">Breed: Oriental</p>
			<p class= "info">Size: Medium</p>
			<p class= "info">Life Span: 10 – 15 years</p>
			<p class= "info">Colour: White, Black, Brown, Lilac, Cinnamon, Fawn, Caramel and Red, Cream, and Apricot</p>
			<p class= "info">Personality: The Siamese and the Oriental might differ in color, but beneath the skin they are identical. The Oriental is talkative and opinionated. He will tell you exactly what he thinks, in a loud, raspy voice, and he expects you to pay attention and act on his advice. Orientals are extremely fond of their people. They like to be “helpful” and will follow you around and supervise your every move. When you are sitting down, an Oriental will be in your lap, and at night he will be in bed with you, probably under the covers with his head on the pillow. Do not get an Oriental if living with a chatty busybody would drive you insane. On the other hand, if you enjoy having someone to talk to throughout the day, an Oriental can be your best friend. </p>

		</div>
		<div class="carousel-item"><img src="assets/images/wideimages/wide.png" alt="" title="">
			<p class= "info">Breed: Javanese</p>
			<p class= "info">Size: Medium</p>
			<p class= "info">Life Span: 10 – 15 years</p>
			<p class= "info">Colour: Cream, Lilac and Red</p>
			<p class= "info">Personality: The Siamese and the Javanese might differ in coat length and color, but beneath the skin they are identical. Javanese are extremely fond of their people. They like to be “helpful” and will follow you around and supervise your every move. When you are sitting down, a Javanese will be in your lap, and at night he will be in bed with you, probably under the covers with his head on the pillow. He is frequently underfoot, so he might not be the best choice for people who are unsteady on their feet or use a walker or cane.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="carousel-item"><img src="assets/images/wideimages/wide.png" alt="" title="">
			<p class= "info">Breed: Ragdoll</p>
			<p class= "info">Size: Large</p>
			<p class= "info">Life Span: 15 – 20 years</p>
			<p class= "info">Colour: Blue, Chocolate, Red, Lilac, and Cream</p>
			<p class= "info">Personality: Unlike many cats, Ragdolls are notable for collapsing into the arms of anyone who holds them, even if they are cradled on their back. They love their people, greeting them at the door, following them around the house, and leaping into a lap or snuggling in bed whenever given the chance. They often learn to come when called or to retrieve toys that are thrown for them. The word most often used to describe them is docile, but that doesn’t mean they are inactive. They like to play with toys and enter into any family activities.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="carousel-item"><img src="assets/images/wideimages/wide.png" alt="" title="">
			<p class= "info">Breed: Maine Coon</p>
			<p class= "info">Size: Large</p>
			<p class= "info">Life Span: 11 – 12 years</p>
			<p class= "info">Colour: White, Black, Silver, Brown, Blue, and Red</p>
			<p class= "info">Personality: The good-natured and affable Maine Coon adapts well to many lifestyles and personalities. He likes being with people and has the habit of following them around, but he isn’t needy. He’s happy to receive attention when you direct it his way, but if you’re busy he’s satisfied to just supervise your doings. Close a door on him and he will wait patiently for you to realize the error of your ways and let him in. He’s not typically a lap cat, but he does like to be near you.</p>

			<p class= "info">Colour: Readish Brown, and Grey</p>
			<p class= "info">Personality:Pixie-Bobs may have been created out of wild passion, but for the most part, Pixie-Bobs are a mellow sort of cat.

			<p class= "info">Breed: Savannah</p>
			<p class= "info">Size: Medium</p>
			<p class= "info">Life Span: 17 – 20 years</p>
			<p class= "info">Colour: Brown, Silver, Black and Smoke</p>
			<p class= "info">Personality: If you want to live with a sweet, quiet lap cat, don’t get a Savannah. This is an active, adventurous feline who enjoys life in the fast lane. Her athletic body allows her to jump to very high places, and her questing spirit leads her to take well to walks on leash, seek out water to play in, and thoroughly explore her surroundings. This is a confident, alert, curious, and friendly cat. While some cats are retiring sorts, most Savannahs are gracious hosts who will greet your guests with aplomb, as well as close companions who will want to spend time interacting with you. Be sure you have a well-developed sense of humor if you live with one of these cats; they are not above playing jokes on you.</p>
