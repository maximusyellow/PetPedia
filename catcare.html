</strong><div><strong>
</strong></div><div>When feeding your cat it is recommend to purchase high-quality, brand-name cat food. Your veterinarian will be able to assess your new cat or kitten and determine the best diet. Factors such as age, activity level and health make a difference in what and how much a cat should eat. Most cats stay relatively clean and rarely need a bath, but you should brush or comb your cat regularly. Frequent brushing helps keep your cat's coat clean, reduces the amount of shedding and cuts down on the incidence of hairballs. To pick up your cat, place one hand behind the front legs and another under the hindquarters. Lift gently. Never pick up a cat by the scruff of the neck or by the front legs.
</div><div>
</div><div>Your pet should have her own clean, dry place in your home to sleep and rest. Line your cat's bed with a soft, warm blanket or towel. Be sure to wash the bedding often. Please keep your cat indoors. Outdoor cats do not live as long as indoor cats. Outdoor cats are at risk of trauma from cars, or from fights with other cats, raccoons and free-roaming dogs. Coyotes are known to eat cats. Outdoor cats are more likely to become infested with fleas or ticks, as well as contract infectious diseases. A nervous cat does best in a quiet home, but that doesn't mean you can't acclimate your kitty if you live somewhere noisy or have kids. What's important is that you give the cat a safe place to hide and that you be patient and work with her. In a more hectic environment, it can take a long time for your nervous kitty to mellow out and come out of her shell, but there are some ways to help her be more confident.
</div><div>
</div><div>To Cleaning Cat Urine: Grab a paper towel, and try to blot up as much of the urine as possible. If it's a large spot and you don't want to waste paper towels, use a cloth towel or old clothes that can be thrown away. If the spot is on the carpet, stand on the wet spot (remember to wear shoes). Don't rub the stain. If it's dry, pour cold water on the stain, and blot. Avoid using detergents with ammonia in them. The "pee smell" in them might encourage your cat to mark the spot again. Just because you can't see the stain, doesn't mean you can't smell the stain. Deodorizing must be part of the equation. Once again, baking soda and a mixture of detergent and water will help minimize odors.
</div><div>
</div><div>Cleaning a litter box entails throwing out the old litter, scrubbing the box clean and adding fresh, new litter. If you use a liner in the litter box, pull the liner (remember our gloves, here) off of each corner and place the entire contents of the bag in a trash bag. If your cat is one of the persnickety creatures that hate litter liners, dump the entire contents of the unlined box into a trash bag. You might need to use your scooper to scrape the dried litter off the box. Open the bag wide enough for the litter to fall inside and not on the floor. A mask is key here because litter dust will begin to scatter. Make sure the trash bag is tied or sealed, and any litter on the floor is swept into the bag too. The best place to ditch your cat's business is not in your kitchen or bathroom trashcans. It's the in the outdoor receptacle that's waiting patiently for the garbage truck on Friday. Using your gloves, wash the litter box inside and out with a sponge, warm water and dish detergent. Include the lid too if it has one, and the scooper. Other harsher cleaning products can be harmful to your kitty. Don't clean the box in your kitchen or bathroom sink or tub. You can use your laundry sink, or better yet, take the litter box outside and use the house bucket. After you scrub, rinse all of the soap. You can scrub repeat the rinse again process if you would like.If the box is outside, it's okay to let it air dry or dry it with a towel. Add a new liner or just add no more than two to three inches of new litter to the unlined box.</div></div>

</strong><div><strong>
</strong></div><div>During the first few weeks of life, a kitten’s primary concerns are feeding, keeping warm, developing social skills and learning how to excrete on his own. In most cases, humans will simply watch the mother cat perform her duties. However, if the kitten in your care has been separated from his mother or if the mother cat has rejected her young or cannot produce enough milk, caring for him is up to you. During the first few weeks of life, a kitten’s primary concerns are feeding, keeping warm, developing social skills and learning how to excrete on his own. In most cases, humans will simply watch the mother cat perform her duties. However, if the kitten in your care has been separated from his mother or if the mother cat has rejected her young or cannot produce enough milk, caring for him is up to you. A mother cat’s milk provides everything a kitten needs during the first four weeks of life. If you have newborn kittens who’ve been separated from their mother, consult with a veterinarian, shelter or experienced foster care giver who can help you find a new mother cat with a small litter-she may be able to nurse the orphaned babies. If you cannot find a foster mother, please consult with your veterinarian about the proper way to bottle-feed with a commercial milk replacer. Please do not offer regular cow’s milk to cats of any age. It is not easily digestible and can cause diarrhea. When the orphaned kittens are three to four weeks old, begin to offer milk replacer in a shallow bowl, then introduce a moist, easily chewable diet. You can make gruel from warmed milk replacer and a high-quality dry or canned kitten food. Serve it in a shallow bowl and feed the kittens several times each day. By five weeks old, they should be getting used to their new diet. By six to seven weeks old, they should be able to chew dry food and you’ll no longer need to moisten it. Kittens are typically fully weaned by around eight weeks of age.</div></div>
