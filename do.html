		<p class= "info">Breed: Dachshund</p>
        <p class= "info">Size: 8 - 9 inches</p>
        <p class= "info">Life Span: 12 – 16 years</p>
        <p class= "info">Colour: Black, Black & Gold, Chocolate, Chocolate & Cream, Cream, Tan, and Blue</p>
        <p class= "info">Personality: The Dachshund is described as clever, lively, and courageous to the point of rashness. He's bred for perseverance, which is another way of saying that he can be stubborn. Dachshunds have a reputation for being entertaining and fearless, but what they want most is to cuddle with their people. For many Dachshund people, this characteristic outweighs having to deal with the breed's insistence on having his own way. The Dachshund personality can also vary with coat type. Because the wirehaired Dachshunds have terrier in their background, they can be mischievous troublemakers. Longhairs are calm and quiet, and Smooths have a personality that lies somewhere in between. Some Mini Dachshunds can be nervous or shy, but this isn't correct for the breed. Avoid puppies that show these characteristics</p>

		<p class= "info">Breed: Akita</p>
        <p class= "info">Size: 2 - 2’4 feet</p>
        <p class= "info">Life Span: 10 – 15 years</p>
        <p class= "info">Colour: White, Brindle, Fawn, Red Fawn, Pinto, Tan, and Sesame</p>
        <p class= "info">Personality: The Akita is a bold and willful dog, naturally wary of strangers but extremely loyal to his family. He is alert, intelligent, and courageous. He tends to be aggressive toward other dogs, especially those of the same sex. He is best suited to a one-dog household. With his family, the Akita is affectionate and playful. He enjoys the companionship of his family and wants to participate in daily activities. He's mouthy and enjoys carrying toys and household items around. Despite the common belief that he never barks, he is in fact noisy, known to grumble, moan — and, yes, bark if he believes the situation warrants it. Be aware the Akita's strong personality can be overwhelming. He is not the dog for a first-time owner, and he is not for the timid. He needs an owner who can provide firm, loving discipline. Activity is essential for this active breed. He needs plenty of exercise to keep him from becoming bored and, in turn, destructive.</p>

		<p class= "info">Breed: German Shepherd</p>
        <p class= "info">Size: 1’10 - 2’2 feet</p>
        <p class= "info">Life Span: 9 – 13 years</p>
        <p class= "info">Colour: Black, Black & Gold, Black & Red, Black & Silver, and sable</p>
        <p class= "info">Personality: he German Shepherd personality is aloof but not usually aggressive. He's a reserved dog; he doesn't make friends immediately, but once he does, he's extremely loyal. With his family he's easy-going and approachable, but when threatened he can be strong and protective, making him an excellent watchdog. This highly intelligent and trainable breed thrives on having a job to do — any job. The German Shepherd can be trained to do almost anything, from alerting a deaf person to a doorbell ring to sniffing out an avalanche victim. One thing he's not good at is being alone for long periods of time. Without the companionship he needs — as well as exercise and the chance to put his intelligence to work — he becomes bored and frustrated. A German Shepherd who's under-exercised and ignored by his family is likely to express his pent-up energy in ways you don't like, such as barking and chewing.</p>

		<div class="carousel-item"><img src="assets/images/wideimages/wide.png" alt="" title="">
		<p class= "info">Size: 1’1 - 1’3 feet</p>
        <p class= "info">Life Span: 12 – 15 years</p>
        <p class= "info">Colour: Tir, Lemone & White, Chocolate Tir, Chocolate & White, Red & White, Orange & White, and Chesenut & White</p>
        <p class= "info">Personality: Beagles are gentle, sweet, and funny. They will make you laugh, but that's when they're not making you cry because of their often naughty behavior. Beagle people spend a lot of time trying to outthink their dogs, and they often must resort to food rewards to lure the Beagle into a state of temporary obedience. Like every dog, the Beagle needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Beagle puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.</p>

		<p class= "info">Breed: American Pitbull Terrier</p>
        <p class= "info">Size: 1’5 - 1’7 feet</p>
        <p class= "info">Life Span: 8 – 15 years</p>
        <p class= "info">Colour: White, Black, Fawn, Brindle, Blue, Tan, and Brown</p>
        <p class= "info">Personality: These dogs love people and have no idea that their size is something of a deterrent to being a lap dog. Confident and keenly aware of their surroundings, they are watchdogs in that they may alert you to the presence of strangers, but that's primarily because they're eager to greet "their" guests. While their love of people makes them failures as guard dogs, their courage is unmatched and they will defend their family with their lives. Like every dog, American Pit Bull Terriers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your your puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.</p>

		<div class="carousel-item"><img src="assets/images/wideimages/wide.png" alt="" title="">
		<p class= "info">Breed: Pembroke Welsh Corgi</p>
        <p class= "info">Size: 0’10 - 1 feet</p>
        <p class= "info">Life Span: 12 – 14 years</p>
        <p class= "info">Colour: Fawn, Black & Gold, Tan, Blue Belton, Blue, and Sable</p>
        <p class= "info">Personality: Although Pembrokes are still used as working dogs, they are most often seen as family pets these days. They are known for being happy, loving, and intelligent, but with a stubborn or independent streak at times. They are easy to train, but don't expect your Pembroke to be subservient. They like to think for themselves. Although they want to please their owners, food is a great motivator for them when training. Proceed with caution: Pembrokes love to eat and can become obese if their food intake isn't moderated. Pembrokes also make good watchdogs. They can be suspicious of strangers, and will be quick to bark if they feel that something or someone is threatening their home and family. Like every dog, the Pembroke needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Pembroke puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.</p>

		<p class= "info">Breed: Doberman Pinscher</p>
        <p class= "info">Size: 2 - 2’4 feet</p>
        <p class= "info">Life Span: 10 – 15 years</p>
        <p class= "info">Colour: Black, Black & Rust, White, Red & Rust, Blue & Rust, Fawn & Rust, Tan, Fawn, and Blue</p>
        <p class= "info">Personality: A super-intelligent and super-active dog — that's what you get when you get a Doberman Pinscher. You also get an extremely loyal, trustworthy dog who's playful and fun-loving with his family. He's a natural protector who won't hesitate to act when he thinks his family is under threat, but he is not aggressive without reason.</p>

		<p class= "info">Breed: American Eskimo</p>
        <p class= "info">Size: 1’3 - 1’7 feet</p>
        <p class= "info">Life Span: 13 - 15 years</p>
        <p class= "info">Colour: White, and Biscuit</p>
        <p class= "info">Personality: Not only does the American Eskimo Dog have a winning look, but he's also got a winning personality. He's spunky, clever, plays hard, and loves vigorous exercise. Because he is naturally suspicious of strangers, he makes an excellent watchdog. Eskies must have regular opportunities to vent their energy and use their busy minds. Otherwise, they can be rambunctious and bored, which usually leads to barking and chewing. A bored American Eskimo Dog can wreak havoc on your home and yard. The strong-willed Eskie also needs a confident owner who can take charge in teaching and leading him. He learns quickly, however, so training is fun and highly successful. Don't plan on leaving this breed alone too much. </p>

		<p class= "info">Breed: Bearded Collie</p>
        <p class= "info">Size: 1’8 - 1’10 feet</p>

        <p class= "info">Colour: Tir, Black, Fawn, Blue, Black & Brown, and Brown</p>
        <p class= "info">Personality: A Beardie is smart, resourceful, and confident. His bouncy, bubbly personality makes him fun to be with, but when it comes to training he can be an independent thinker who likes to have his own way. He's a boisterous playmate for children and has a sense of humor that makes him a joy to be around.</p>

		<p class= "info">Breed: Belgian Malinois</p>
        <p class= "info">Size: 2’0 - 2’2 feet</p>
        <p class= "info">Life Span: 12 – 14 years</p>
        <p class= "info">Colour: Black-tipped Fawn, Tan, and Mahogany</p>
        <p class= "info">Personality: This is an outstanding working dog who is confident and protective in any situation. He's affectionate with family members but reserved toward strangers until he takes their measure. The watchdog abilities of the Malinois are excellent. He protects his people and property with only as much force as is required. Shyness and aggression are never appropriate in this breed. That said, temperament doesn't just happen. It's affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.</p>

		<p class= "info">Breed: Belgian Sheepdog</p>
        <p class= "info">Size: 1’10 - 2’2 feet</p>
        <p class= "info">Life Span: 10 – 14 years</p>
        <p class= "info">Colour: Black</p>
        <p class= "info">Personality: The ideal Belgian Sheepdog is smart, brave, alert, and devoted to his family. He's described as always in motion when not under command. His observation skills make him an excellent watchdog, but his herding heritage makes him naturally distrustful of strangers. If he isn't properly trained and socialized this distrust can lead to aggressive behavior.

He's affectionate and friendly with people he knows, especially family members. </p>

		<p class= "info">Breed: Bloodhound</p>
        <p class= "info">Size: 1’11 - 2’3 feet</p>
        <p class= "info">Life Span: 9 – 13 years</p>
        <p class= "info">Colour: Liver & Tan, Black & Gold, and Tan</p>
        <p class= "info">Personality: The dignified Bloodhound is a study in contradictions. He's docile yet stubborn, determined but not quarrelsome, affectionate but somewhat shy with people he doesn't know. When it comes to training, he's sensitive to kindness or correction, but he still wants to do things his way. He can sniff out the slightest hint of a trail, but as a watchdog or guard dog, he's poor, given his love of people. Some Bloodhounds can be vocal, barking up a storm when they're excited. Others are nice and quiet. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them.</p>

		<p class= "info">Breed: Border Collie</p>
        <p class= "info">Size: 1’6 - 1’10 feet</p>
        <p class= "info">Life Span: 10 – 17 years</p>
        <p class= "info">Colour: Blue Merle, White, Black, Blue, Lilac, Brindle, Dark Brown, Chocolate, and Gold</p>
        <p class= "info">Personality: Quite simply, the Border Collie is a dynamo. His personality is characteristically alert, energetic, hardworking, and smart. He learns quickly — so quickly that it's sometimes difficult to keep him challenged. This breed likes to be busy. In fact, he must be busy or he becomes bored, which leads to annoying behavior, such as barking, digging, or chasing cars. He's not a dog to lie quietly on the front porch while you sip a glass of lemonade; he thrives on activity. Remember, he was bred to run and work all day herding sheep. The Border Collie is also renowned for being highly sensitive to his handler's every cue, from a whistle to a hand signal to a raised eyebrow. Of course, the Border Collie isn't perfect.</p>

		<p class= "info">Breed: Chihuahua</p>
        <p class= "info">Size: 6 - 9 inches</p>
        <p class= "info">Life Span: 12 – 20 years</p>
        <p class= "info">Colour: Fawn, Black, Gold, Chocolate, Cream, and Gold</p>
        <p class= "info">Personality: The bold and confident Chihuahua is often described as being terrier-like. His alert nature and suspicion of strangers make him an excellent watchdog. He's sensitive and thrives on affection and companionship. Chihuahuas often bond to a single person, although they're usually willing to make friends with new people if properly introduced. Expect them to be a little reserved at first, though. Chihuahuas can be timid if they're not properly socialized as puppies. Like every dog, Chihuahuas need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Chihuahua puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.</p>
